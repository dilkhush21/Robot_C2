# Robot_C2
It's is a Humanoid robot. Currently it is in developing stage.
## Project directory
- **gassistpi** -google assistant project

- **Robot_support_file** -  This folder contains config files

- **edubot** - Ros based motion of robot 

- **face recog** - face recognistion module

- **node_red_scripts**- It contains the UI and backend files 

- **robo.sh** - This is a script file to run ros launch file.
   It start the ros and robot's motion rosnode in background  (this script file will be automatically run by robot.services)

## Creating Image from Scratch
1) Take a blank memory card
2) Install latest version of raspbian from raspbian.org - Note down username and password for later use
3)  Copy wifi_supplicant.conf (edit wifi settings) and ssh from "Robot_support_file" folder of repository to boot partition of the memory card
4)  Insert memory card to raspbarry pi
5)  Check ip of pi using ip scanner - you may narrow down the search range to IPs that you wifirouter is currently supporting
6)  Use "MobaXtern" or any SSH client to connect to the pi 
7)  *Open GUI using command startlxde
8)  copy the downloaded git repo all files and folder to /home/pi 
9)  edit /etc/dphys-swapfile and change CONF_SWAPSIZE to 2048
10)  Open Chromium from startmenu bar
11)  Go to git repository and "Robot_support_file" to download opencv.sh and install_ROS.sh to pi's /home/pi folder
12)  In terminal use ```chmod +x  opencv.sh``` and ```chmod +x  install_ROS.sh```to give permission
13)  run opencv.sh using command ```\opencv.sh```. .
14)  The pi will automatically restart after completing the script
15)  To check whether opencv installed propely or not in your system use command ```python3``` on terminal and then ```import cv2```
16)  run install_ros.sh using command ```\install_ROS.sh```
17)  ros_workspace named ros_catkin_ws will be created automatically after using script install_ros.sh
18)  To check whether RoS is properly installled or not ,use command ```roscore``` to check
19)  if you get some output then you have succesfully installed  
20)  you have to install all ros packages inside that folder
21)  now copy the c2_motion(git folder) to  /home/pi/ros_catkin_ws
22)  use ```sudo nano ~/.bashrc``` command  and add ```source ~/ros_catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash``` 
23)  to compile the newly compiled package use ```catkin_make``` 
24)  Go into robot_support folder and execute config_file.sh ```.\config_file.sh```
25)  Install node-red by startmenu->prefrence->recommendedsoftware
26)  *start the node-red server by ```node-red``` command
27)  enter command ```sudo systemctl enable nodered.service``` to autostart nodered server at boot
28)  import the flow.json from node_red_scripts folder (
29)  add missing palette by going to manage palette section
30)  doownload following palette -> node-red-contrib-camerapi,node-red-contrib-dht-sensor,node-red-dashboard
31)  now we will install customised google assistant 
32)  use command ```sudo chmod +x ./GassistPi/scripts/gassist-installer.sh``` to make installer exectable and ```sudo  ./GassistPi/scripts/gassist-installer.sh``` to execute
33)  enter the details of the credential from robot_support_file/gassist_credential file
