## Creating Image from Scratch
1) Take a blank memory card
2) Install latest version of raspbian from raspbian.org - Note down username and password for later use
3) Copy wifi_supplicant.conf (edit wifi settings) and ssh from "Robot_support_file" folder of repository to boot partition of the memory card
4)  Insert memory card to raspbarry pi
5)  Check ip of pi using ip scanner - you may narrow down the search range to IPs that you wifirouter is currently supporting
6)  Use "MobaXtern" or any SSH client to connect to the pi 
7)  Open GUI using command startlxde
8)  edit /etc/dphys-swapfile and change CONF_SWAPSIZE to 2048
10)  Open Chromium from startmenu bar
11)  Go to git repository and "Robot_support_file" to download opencv.sh and install_ROS.sh to pi's /home/pi folder
12)  In terminal use ```chmod +x  opencv.sh``` and ```chmod +x  install_ROS.sh```to give permission
13)  run opencv.sh using command ```\opencv.sh```. .
14)  The pi will automatically restart after completing the script
15)  run opencv.sh using command ```\install_ROS.sh```
